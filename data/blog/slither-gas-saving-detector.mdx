When auditing smart contracts at [AuditOne](https://auditone.io/top-auditors), I find it very handy to use
a static analyzer that can automatically detect vulnerabilities and suggest a fix for them. One of my favorite
tools is [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither).

Slither's architecture is built around detectors. A detector is a class thatâ€¦
There are - as of today 23.09.2022 - 47 detectors in total. Most of them target actual vulnerabilities. Few of
them help you write better code. Like pointing out the use of an unstable solidity version, or similarity of
argument names.

What I couldn't find, was a detector that points out gas saving possibilities. I have encountered in many projects
lines of code that can be written more gas efficient. One of the most common findings, is developers comparing
a `uint256 > 0`. Which is technically correct. For example if you want to make sure that the function is receiving
ether, you can check for `msg.value > 0`.
What would happen if instead we use `uint256 != 0`? Since a `uint256` ranges anything from 0 to 2^256^ - 1,
comparing `uint256 != 0` has the same effect, but consumes less gas.

## Todo

[ ] add example

[ ] explain detector

[ ] show tool code (link to repo?)
